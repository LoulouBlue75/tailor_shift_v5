## 4. DATA MODEL

### 4.1 Assessment Schema

```typescript
interface CapabilityAssessment {
  id: string;
  talent_id: string;
  assessment_type: 'self' | 'situational' | 'brand' | '360';
  completed_at: string;
  
  scores: {
    service_excellence: number; // 0-100
    leadership: number;
    image_brand: number;
    operations: number;
    business_development: number;
    learning_agility: number;
  };
  
  level: 'developing' | 'proficient' | 'advanced' | 'expert';

    answer: string;
    score: number;
  }[];

}
```

### 4.2 Profile Aggregation

For talents with multiple experiences, aggregate scores:
- **Most recent:** Primary weight (60%)
- **Peak performance:** Secondary weight (30%)
- **Average:** Baseline (10%)

### 4.3 Database Schema

```sql
-- Assessments table (enhanced)
ALTER TABLE assessments ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS scores JSONB DEFAULT '{
  "service_excellence": null,
  "leadership": null,
  "image_brand": null,
  "operations": null,
  "business_development": null,
  "learning_agility": null
}';

ALTER TABLE assessments ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS level TEXT 
  CHECK (level IN ('developing', 'proficient', 'advanced', 'expert'));
```

---

## 5. MATCHING INTEGRATION

### 5.1 Capability Fit Dimension

The "Capability Fit" dimension in the matching engine uses this framework:

```typescript
function calculateCapabilityFit(
  talentScores: CapabilityScores,
  opportunityRequirements: CapabilityRequirements
): number {
  const dimensions = [
    'service_excellence',
    'leadership',
    'image_brand',
    'operations',
    'business_development',
    'learning_agility'
  ];
  
  let totalScore = 0;
  let totalWeight = 0;
  
  dimensions.forEach(dim => {
    const required = opportunityRequirements[dim];
    const actual = talentScores[dim];
    
    if (required && actual) {
      const weight = required.importance; // 1-5
      const fit = Math.min(100, (actual / required.minimum) * 100);
      totalScore += fit * weight;
      totalWeight += weight;
    }
  });
  
  return totalWeight > 0 ? totalScore / totalWeight : 50; // Default neutral
}
```

### 5.2 Opportunity Requirements

Brands can specify requirements per dimension:

```typescript
interface CapabilityRequirements {
  service_excellence?: { minimum: number; importance: 1|2|3|4|5 };
  leadership?: { minimum: number; importance: 1|2|3|4|5 };
  image_brand?: { minimum: number; importance: 1|2|3|4|5 };
  operations?: { minimum: number; importance: 1|2|3|4|5 };
  business_development?: { minimum: number; importance: 1|2|3|4|5 };
  learning_agility?: { minimum: number; importance: 1|2|3|4|5 };
}
```
